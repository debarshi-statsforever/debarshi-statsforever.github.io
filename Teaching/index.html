                <b>About the coursework : </b>Sample Survey is one of those topics which is more or less ignored / less popular among students at undergraduate level in India.
                Also, it is not a part of the IIT JAM syllabus but is included in ISI M.Stat entrance syllabus. This course attempts to make 
                a student feel the essence of survey sampling in a probabilistic manner. We will cover the basics and only the basics of the topic, which
                will include a quick revision of discrete probability theory too. Hope you will enjoy this short course.</p>
            <p>

            <ol>
                <li>Discrete Probability</li>

                <b>About the coursework : </b>Undoubtedly the most important topic in the foundational stage of a Statistics student. As you can see
            we have to cover the content of 4 semesters in 4  months, so the way of teaching won't be that much detailed in terms of doing
        derivations and calculations, we seek your effort to try those at home, it will also help you in competitive exams. As the studenst joining
    this course have already learnt probability at theor respective colleges, what I will try to do is give an essence of randomness in my
own way, hopefully some perspectives of which you will find new and interesting. In a nutshell, the course will be more about learning for insight
rather than learning formulas for solving problems.</p>

                <b>About the coursework : </b>Actual learning of Statistics starts here, where mathematical foundations of probability Theory
            meets descriptive statistics. Very important for a budding statistician. My personal favourite course to teach. Again, less calculations
        and more insights due to short time span. Hope you find something new and helpful.</p>
