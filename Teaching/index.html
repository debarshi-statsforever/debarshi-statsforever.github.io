                <b>About the coursework : </b>Sample Survey is one of those topics which is more or less ignored / less popular among students at undergraduate level in India.
                Also, it is not a part of the IIT JAM syllabus but is included in ISI M.Stat entrance syllabus. This course attempts to make 
                a student feel the essence of survey sampling in a probabilistic manner. We will cover the basics and only the basics of the topic, which
                will include a quick revision of discrete probability theory too. Hope you will enjoy this short course.</p>
