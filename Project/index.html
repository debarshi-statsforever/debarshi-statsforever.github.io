            <div class="subheading mb-3">Supervisor : Dr.Arindam Chatterjee</div>
            <p>A review on the available literature on probabilistic graphical models was done.What are graphical models?
                Here we learnt how are they useful in statistics and examples of different types of graphical models.
                Here we particularly focus on undirected graphical models where all the nodes are from a well known distribution 
                -Multivariate Normal.Simple to advanced and modern methods to decipher the underlying probability distribution 
                through graphs are presented.Here we did simulations to verify the theoritical facts and also tried to implement our 
                learnings some real life datasets</p>

        <div class="subheading mb-3">Supervisor : Dr.Deepayan Sarkar</div>
        <p>This was done during our "Multivariate Analysis" coursework in the 1st Year of M.Stat in ISI.Here we illustrated the working principles of Support Vector Machines (SVM),K Nearest Neighbours (KNN) Algorithm, Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis(QDA) to solve classification problems.We artificially created different types of data and compared the above mentioned methods to see their advantages and disadvantages in different situations.Finally an application on real life dataset was done.</p>

        <div class="subheading mb-3">Supervisor : Dr.Isha Dewan </div>
        <p>This was done as a part of ourNonparametric Inference and Sequential Methodscoursework in M.Stat 1st Year.We start with 
            the simplest form of density estimation i.e. Histograms.We show their drawbacks and step by step 
            trying to overcome them, we eventually illustrate the idea of Kernel Density Estimation.We simulate from different 
            distributions and taking different choices of kernels show how good the estimates holds.We also verify 
            the asymptotic properties.Using a similar approach via kernels, we try to estimate the CDF also.Finally we do a case
             study.Essentially,practical verification of theoritical results learnt in class and applying that to real dataset 
             was the objective</p><br>

        <div class="subheading mb-3">Supervisor : Dr.Swagata Nandi</div>
        <p>This was done as a part of our Regrression Techniques coursework of M.Stat 1st Year.A data was given to us with the
            response and the predictors mentioned.Starting with the basic linear regression model with all predictors involved, we 
            performed regression diagnostics.We did appropriate transformations to the data to remove unwanted stuff like
             heteroscedasticity,multicollinearity,non-normality of errors,etc.Also,variable selection was performed.We finally 
             present the model which is the best fit to the data.Basically practical application of theoritical concepts learnt
              in the coursework.</p>

        <div class="subheading mb-3">Supervisor : Dr.Ayan Chandra </div>
        <p>This was done as my dissertation paper in the 6th semester of B.Sc Statistics Hons at St.Xavier's College, Kolkata.
            Here we try analyse the number of goals scored in the UEFA Champions' League over the years.Naturally an application 
            of time series analysis on real dataset.Although it is clear that it is a time series data, we justify that 
            what made us think that the number of goals scored in successive years may be correlated.We try to build a
             simple mathematical model for the goal ratio- which is more reasonable to work with rather than the number of goals.
             After estimating the trend using Mathematical Curve Fitting, we try to model the remaining part using ARMA.</p>
