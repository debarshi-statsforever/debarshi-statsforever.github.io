                            <p>We first try to understand what are graphical models and why are they needed. 
                            Then we briefly discuss about the existing literature on one of the simplest cases which is when the nodes of the graph jointly follow a multivariate normal distribution. Next, we move on to study what methods can be applied when the data is not normally distributed, which is often the case in practice. To study non gaussian scenarios, we do a comprehensive literature review on nonparametric methods for continuous data and also study discrete graphical models. At last, we try to see if we can have a common framework to study both discrete and continuous variables together. In most of the setups, we try to study the performance of the methods in different situations like for large sample size, for deviation from normality and for higher dimensions.</p>
