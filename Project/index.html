        <div class="subheading mb-3">Supervisor : Dr.Deepayan Sarkar</div>
        <p>This was done during our "Multivariate Analysis" coursework in the 1st Year of M.Stat in ISI.Here we illustrated the working principles of Support Vector Machines (SVM),K Nearest Neighbours (KNN) Algorithm, Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis(QDA) to solve classification problems.We artificially created different types of data and compared the above mentioned methods to see their advantages and disadvantages in different situations.Finally an application on real life dataset was done.</p>

        <p>We did this project while our "Nonparametric Inference and Sequential Methods" coursework of M.Stat 1st year in ISI.A detailed review of the available literature on Kernel Density estimation was done.Lot of simulations were performed to verify and justify the theoritical results and understand the underlying mechanisn how KDE actually works.</p>

        <div class="subheading mb-3">Supervisor : Dr.Ayan Chandra </div>
        <p>This was done as my dissertation paper in the 6th semester of B.Sc Statistics Hons at St.Xavier's College, Kolkata.The main idea was to build a simplemathematical model for the number of goals scored in each season of UEFA Champions' League which can be further used for forecasting.It was mainly an application of Time Series Analysis.</p>
